    <section>
        <h1 id="page-header">What is SEO?</h1>
        <p>SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, 
            is all about making your website more 
            visible to search engines like Google. 
            By optimizing your site, you increase 
            its chances of appearing in search results 
            when people look for services or products you offer. 
            This visibility is key to attracting more 
            visitors, which can help your business grow online.
            Imagine your website as a digital storefront. 
            SEO is like putting up a bright, welcoming sign 
            that guides potential customers right to your door. 
            With effective SEO, you not only increase traffic 
            to your site but also attract the right kind of 
            visitorsâ€”those who are genuinely interested in 
            what your business offers. Investing in SEO means 
            you're investing in the long-term success of your 
            business. It helps build your online presence, 
            connects you with your target audience, and 
            ultimately drives growth by turning visitors 
            into customers.</p>
        <h1 id="page-header">SEO vs. Ads</h1>
        <p> SEO and ads are two different approaches to 
            increasing your online visibility. While SEO 
            focuses on optimizing your website to appear 
            organically in search results, ads involve paid 
            placements. SEO is a long-term strategy that 
            improves your site's overall visibility and 
            attracts visitors actively searching for your 
            products or services. It's like building a strong 
            foundation for your online presence. Ads, on 
            the other hand, offer immediate visibility but 
            require ongoing investment. They can be 
            particularly effective for short-term campaigns 
            or targeting specific audiences. While ads can 
            drive quick traffic, SEO helps build lasting 
            credibility and sustainable growth. Many 
            businesses find that a combination of both 
            strategies yields the best results, leveraging 
            the immediate impact of ads alongside the 
            long-term benefits of SEO.</p>
